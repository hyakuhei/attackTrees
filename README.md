## WIP warning
This is a work in progress, a toy that I've been working on over the weekend. It's on GitHub just as a safe place to save it. It's in a public repo because it's not sensitive but I'm not encouraging anyone to use it :)

## Idea
Programatically model trees like those described by [Kelly Shortridge](https://twitter.com/swagitda_), [here](https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/security-decision-trees-with-graphviz/)

The goal is to decouple the model from the view. In reality I'm removing the need for the user to understand Graphviz and introducing a need for them to understand python.

## Jupyter support (needs better documentation)
If your system (or venv) has attacktree installed you can now build trees inside of Jupyter notebooks:
![Screen shot of jupyter notebook with k8s attack tree](images/jupyter_k8s.png)

Models differentiate between controls that are *imlemented* and those that are not; modelling both the current security posture, and a potential (improved) posture.

The `renderer.render()` function can toggle whether to include unimplemented things in it's graph.

# Prerequisites for Installation or Development 
Your system needs an installed version of graphviz for rendering to work.
On MacOS this can be installed using `brew install graphviz`

See https://graphviz.org/download/ for other options.

Only python3.9 is supported at this time.

# Installation
attacktree is available in PyPI, we recommend installing in a virtualenv
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install attacktree
```

## Instructions for running
`S3Simple.py` is a simple model, containing only a single path in some hypothetical S3 threat model. It can be run simply:
```
python3 examples/S3Simple.py
```

`S3Complex.py` contains some potential blocking mitigations, things the security team might be considering but hasn't implemented yet.
```
python3 examples/S3Complex.py
```


## Methodology
In messing with this idea, I've found the easiest approach is to map the existing paths out first, without consideration for things you might implement. To see what that looks like checkout [examples/S3Simple.py](eexamples/S3Simple.py). After this one can either create a new tree with potential mitigations _or_ add them to the existing tree, for examples purposes I chose the former; [examples/S3Complex.py](examples/S3Complex.py).

See [Methodology.md](Methodology.md) for more thoughts on how this might work in practice.

## Node types
There are serveral types of node [modelled](models.py), they're mostly self documenting.
* Action: An attacker action expected to achieve some result
* Detect: A detection, a node that represents our (security team) ability to detect that action
* Block: Our ability to block that action
* Discovery: Knowledge that an attacker gains through successful completion of an action.

## Line types
There are two types of line, solid and dashed (note, these can be changed in [style.json](style.json)). 
* Solid: This path exists today
* Dashed: This path represents what would happen if we implemented a control that is currently not implemented.

The last line in each of those files is a call to render the tree:
```
    renderer.render(
        node=root,
        renderUnimplemented=True,
        style=style,
        fname="example_complexS3",
        fout="png"
    )
```

I imagine that in general usage, we'd just want one model for a specific attacker; not a _simple and a _complex_ one. However, it's very useful to be able to see what those different graphs look like, as the latter models things we _could_ do but are currently *unimplemented* - for that reason the `render()` function has a parameter to enable or disable rendering of unimplemented paths. This way you can record everything in one tree (and maybe add that into version control, as a system of record) and render different outputs, one that shows your current reality, and one that shows your potential reality (hopefully improved).

Below is the output of running the _complex example with `renderUnimplemented=True`, note that if you set this to `False` the generated graph looks the same as `examples/S3Simple.py.py`

# Development

## Instructions for setup
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
